# DAMASK simulation guide and practice
DAMASK (The Düsseldorf Advanced Material Simulation Kit) is a powerful [open-source code](https://github.com/damask-multiphysics/DAMASK) created at MPIE (Max-Planck-Institut für Eisenforschung GmbH, now _Max-Planck-Institut für Nachhaltige Materialien GmbH_), which can simulate various phenomena and predict materials properties in the framework of Crystal Plasticity. It is widely used in academics and industry. Extensive informations can be found in this [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927025618302714).

# notebooks to start with
In this collection of ipython notebooks I try to introduce you the very _basics_ of using DAMASK to run _simple_ simulations. You need to [install DAMASK](https://damask.mpie.de/installation/index.html) first and then you can follow the following tutorials.
- `demo_minimal.ipynb`   : the very first DAMASK simulation you can run
- `demo_howto.ipynb`     : a complete guide for writing (and understanding) input files of DAMASK, basic and advanced visualization techniques
- `test_mat_setup.ipynb` : assemble (and test) a material file according to DAMASK example parameters
